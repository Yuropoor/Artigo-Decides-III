Abstract:

The objective of the present study was to evaluate thepharmacokinetic parameters for both S- and R-ibuprofen en-antiomers in very premature neonates (gestational agestrictly inferior to 28 weeks) and possible relationships be-tween the pharmacokinetic parameters and variouscovariates. Newborns were randomized to receive ibuprofenor placebo for the prophylactic treatment of patent ductusarteriosus (PDA) at an initial dose of 10 mg/kg ibuprofenwithin 6 hours after birth, followed by two 5-mg/kg doses at24-hour intervals (n = 52). If a PDA was still present after-wards, a curative course of ibuprofen using the same dosageregimen was administered (n = 10). A sparse sampling strat-egy was used because only 2 samples were collected after thethird prophylactic injection and 1 after the third curative in-jection. A model including the chiral transformation of R- toS-ibuprofen was fitted to the concentration-time data using apopulation approach (NONMEM). R- and S-ibuprofen t1/2were about 10 hours and 25.5 hours, respectively. Afterprophylactic treatment, the mean clearance of R-ibuprofen(CLR = 12.7 mL/h) was about 2.5-fold higher than for S-ibuprofen (CLS = 5.0 mL/h). In addition, clearance of R- andS-ibuprofen increased significantly with gestational age. Themean estimation of R-ibuprofen clearance was found to behigher than for S-ibuprofen, and the clearance of both enan-tiomers increased with gestational age. This should be con-sidered to assess pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic rela-tionships of ibuprofen in premature neonates andsubsequently to understand and refine the use of ibuprofenin managing PDA either as a prophylactic or curativetreatment.
